Waitlist times for organ donations vary significantly across the country. From 2005 to 2012, more than 25% of patients died on the waitlist in New York’s region, while in the Southeastern region the same statistic was less than 14% [goldberg2015]. In a more personal example, my best friend’s wife has been battling cystic fibrosis her entire life (for the purpose of this proposal I refer to her as ‘Karen’). At the age of 27, Karen’s lungs started to fail rapidly, and she was in dire need of a double-lung transplant. Living in the New York City metro area, the waitlist was so long that she was informed by her doctor that based on her lung allocation score, she couldn’t even be placed on the waitlist. Frustrated and hopeless, Karen did research on her own only to find out that if she moved to the Raleigh-Durham area (in the vicinity of the Duke Medical Center), she would not only be able to be officially placed on the waitlist, but that she would have a significantly higher chance of living a longer, healthier life with 2 new lungs. Approximately 3 months later, Karen moved to North Carolina. Weeks later, Karen successfully completed the screening process and was officially placed on the waitlist. Day 1 on the waitlist, Karen got the call informing her that two donated lungs looked like a match, and off she went to receive new lungs and breathe fresh air. With the data and data science tools that exist today, we can and must do a better job deciding where and when patients should be placed on an organ transplant waitlist, and enable data-driven decision making to drastically decrease waitlist mortality. 1.2 Use real-time data to determine where ‘high priority’ should be located to maximize their chance of a successful transplant. The proposed solution is a secure, web-based platform that both patients and providers can use to determine where patients will have the greatest chance of success based on their specific needs (organ, blood type, and other matching criteria). The interactive tool will allow patients and providers to input identified variables and analyze options for relocation across the country. While selection criteria will clearly need to be refined as this project develops, criteria could include number of successful organ transplants completed, estimated waitlist time, population demographics, and overall cost of living (more to follow on how to fund relocation expenses). A rigorous process will be used to determine the optimal parameters and metrics to use in the proposed tool. Because of the variability in needs for different types of organ transplants, our team will initially focus on one organ type in order to develop a proof of concept. In looking at the different organ types that can be used, liver transplants provide a relatively large sample size (second by organ type for total candidates currently on a waitlist) and a wide range of severity for patients on the waitlist (mild complications to critically ill in ICU). Following alignment on the organ to initially focus on, the team will determine the data sources required to train a machine learning algorithm. Fortunately, this is a problem that has been addressed for quite some time, and there are certain metrics that are already agreed upon and utilized. For example, the seriousness of a patient in need of a liver transplant is scored using the Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (or MELD) method [sutterhealth]. Extensive research will be completed to define data requirements and ensure our team has access to appropriate data sources. Finally, it is important to note how this tool differs from what already exists in this space. Tools today primarily exist to determine how the medical community should optimally use an organ after it becomes available. The tool proposed here leverages historically data to determine where the patient should be optimally located before an organ becomes available. The data exist to make accurate, proactive decisions, and we should leverage this data to enable life-saving outcomes for patients. 1.3 Result: Dramatically reduce the organ transplant waitlist mortality rate by relocating people to where they have the greatest chance of receiving the organ they desperately need. Clearly, the primary goal of the tool is to determine where patients should be located with the overall goal of reducing waitlist mortality. While (if successful) this tool could save lives, it is important to think through a few of the unintended consequences of implementing this solution. Relocating from New York City to Durham, NC is not cheap. Moreover, the period of time you will be relocated is largely unknown, depending on when an organ becomes available. However, this should not be a limiting factor, and patients should not be forced to stay in an area because they do not have the means to move. If the solution proves to be highly effective, the results should be taken to the government with the hopes of developing needs-based grants to assist with the financial burden of relocating. Additionally, because of the real-time nature of the interactive tool, it could recommend moving a patient more than once. This could become troublesome and quite confusing for patients and providers. This potential consequence will have to be strongly considered as the tool is developed. Ideally, patients will be moved only once based on severity of their condition and where they have the greatest chance of success. A tool such as this cannot be taken lightly. While it does have the potential to save numerous lives, the tool is aiding in decisions that impact patients with serious conditions across the country. Our team understands the severity of such consequences, and is tremendously excited to determine how data science can be used to #MaximizeTheGiftOfLife. "],

However, what should frustrate patients, providers, and society as a whole is the failure of countless efforts to change the trajectory of this deadly disease. While one could come up with numerous reasons why this is the case, the problem can be defined by two primary drivers: The U.S. healthcare system is not incentivized to keep healthy people healthy: In analyzing each sub-sector of the healthcare industry, it is clear that the majority of business models are built around treating sick people (and for most organizations … treating as many sick people as possible). Because organizations are rewarded for making as many unhealthy people healthy as possible, there is a lack of focus on preventing disease (particularly chronic conditions such as diabetes). Medical providers see as many sick people as possible in 15 minute increments. Health insurers benefit from an increase in procedures and treatments (by increasing premiums and capturing a set % of their customers’ expenses). Pharmaceutical and medical device companies clearly benefit from this trend of focusing on people that are already sick. How different would this situation look if healthcare players and patients were incentivized to keep healthy people healthy? Patients are not sufficiently motivated and incentivized to change behavior: Do patients want to live with a disease which threatens their livelihood? Absolutely not. However, patients consistently know they are either at risk of diabetes or have pre-diabetes and end up having a more advanced form of diabetes. Healthcare providers do make efforts to limit the severity of this (and other) diseases. However, patients are not provided the right incentives to change. Changing behavior for something that might happen in the future (i.e. severe type 2 diabetes) is very challenging. However, if patients are incentivized monetarily while they are healthy it could meaningfully change their behavior and lifestyle. What if we used the power of data science and the prevalence of customer data on e-commerce websites to identify patients most at risk for diabetes and incentivize them (monetarily) to prevent the onset of the disease? 2.2 Predict individuals at risk to diabetes and incentivize them to stay healthy. The proposed tool will be two-fold: predict individuals who are at risk to diabetes and incentive those identified to change behaviors. The development of this tool is contingent on gaining access to a large e-commerce company’s data (e.g., Amazon, Walmart, and Target) along with a large health insurer’ data (e.g., United Healthcare, Aetna). Predicting at risk individuals: Waist size along has been found to be just one indicator of diabetes. [WebMd2012] The initial primary objective of the proposed tool is to identify healthy people that are most at risk for diabetes. To do so, the tool will leverage a large data set from an e-commerce company and a health insurer in order to determine which shopping behaviors and characteristics put patients at severe risk for diabetes. In this analysis, a training set would be established using historical shopping behavior and the diagnosis of type 2 diabetes. By accessing a large data set of e-commerce customers and patients, a machine learning algorithm will be able to determine the key indicators that put an individual at risk for diabetes over the following 2-5 years. Incentivizing and preventing diabetes: Identifying patients at risk is clearly only half the battle. Patients at risks must be sufficiently motivated to drastically change behavior. Currently, our healthcare system assumes that patient education is the answer. This is clearly not effective. The proposed tool will reward at risk patients financially when they show clear signs of changing their behavior. This tool proposes that we use the following 2-step process: Determine key metrics that (if changed) will drastically reduce the probably that a patient will be diagnosed with diabetes. Examples include BMI, blood pressure, body fat percentage, and cholesterol. Develop a system that rewards patients (again … financially) on a regular basis if they meet or maintain their agreed upon targets. As this new tool gathers more data, it will continue to refine the key metrics utilized and the incentives that are offered to patients through the use of machine learning. The data provided to develop the tool will certainly be useful, but the real-time data collected will be even more important as the tool gets more effective at identifying patients at risk, developing key metrics to track, and incentivizing patients appropriately. 2.3 Result: Employers pay significantly less to keep healthy employees healthy. Results are two-fold. Most importantly, the tool will prevent healthy individuals from being diagnosed with type 2 diabetes (and eventually other chronic care conditions). Secondly, employers will pay significantly less for their employees’ healthcare costs (not to mention the fact that healthy workers are more productive). While the potential results are clear, the business model to be utilized will need considerable thought and consideration. The value created will need to be shared between the parties involved (e-commerce company, health insurers, and employers). While the proposed tool could be created within any of these types of companies, our team is initially proposing to develop the product separately. As such, clearly accessing the data required will be a challenge. Our team’s belief is companies will be willing to invest in pilot to determine the value at stake. As our team develops a proof of concept, it will clearly need to think through further business model refinement. We believe that data science has the power to drastically change the preventative healthcare landscape and are confident that our tool can effectively target at risk patients and meaningfully change unhealthy behavior. #KeepingHealthyPeopleHealthy "]
