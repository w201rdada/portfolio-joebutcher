# Optimizing organ waitlist location across the United States (#maximizethegiftoflife)

#### Keywords

## On average, 20 people die each day while waiting for an organ transplant.

Waitlist times vary across the country. People in dire need of an organ can be optimally relocated to maximize the chance of receiving a life saving transplant.

## Use real-time data to determine where 'high priority' should relocate to receive transplant.

Develop model that will continously advise where to relocate patients based on liklihood of receiving transplant.

## Result:  Dramatically reduce the organ transplant waitlist mortality rate by moving people to where they have the greatest chance of receiving the donor they need.
