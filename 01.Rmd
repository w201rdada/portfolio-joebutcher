# Optimizing organ waitlist location across the United States (#maximizethegiftoflife)

## On average, 20 people die each day while waiting for an organ transplant.

Waitlist times for organ donations vary significantly across the country. From 2005 to 2012, more than 25% of patients died on the waitlist in New York’s region, while in the Southeastern region the same statistic was less than 14%. In a more personal example, my best friend’s wife has been battling cystic fibrosis her entire life. At the age of 27, her lungs started to fail rapidly, and she was in dire need of a double-lung transplant. Living in the New York City metro area, the waitlist was so long that she was informed by her doctor that based on her lung allocation score, she couldn’t even be placed on the waitlist. Frustrated and hopeless, Caitlin did research on her to find out that if she moved to the Durham-Raleigh area (in the vicinity of Duke Medical Center), she would not only be able to place officially placed on the waitlist, but that she would have significantly higher chance of living a longer, healthier life with 2 new lungs. Approximately 3 months later, Caitlin moved to North Carolina. Weeks later, Caitlin was through the screening process and officially on the waitlist. Day 1 on the waitlist, Caitlin got the call informing her that two donated lungs looked like a match, and off she went to receive new lungs and breathe fresh air. With the data and data science tools that exist today, we can and must do a better job deciding where and when patients should be placed on organ waitlist, and enable data-driven decision making to drastically decrease waitlist mortality.

## Use real-time data to determine where 'high priority' should be located to maximize their chance of a successful transplant.

While a tool exists to determine where an organ could be used once it’s available, little thought has been put into how to optimally place patients based on the organ in need and key matching criteria (e.g., blood type). The proposed tool would leverage historical data on organ donations across the United States in order to develop a machine learning algorithm to optimize the location of ‘high priority’ patients, increasing their chance to receive a life-saving organ. 
Before creating the optimal tool, thorough research would be conducted in order to determine the optimal parameters and metrics. In doing so, the tool would first be developed for one specific organ type. In looking at the different organ types that can be chosen, liver donations provide a relatively large sample size (second by organ type for total candidates currently on a waitlist) and the range of severity for patients on the waitlist (mild complications to critically ill in ICU). Fortunately, a scale already exists to determine the seriousness of the patient (Model for End-Stage Liver Disease, or MELD). The tool will leverage MELD data in conjunction with all other data available (basic health data, location of patient, time on waitlist, mortality rate, etc.) with the end goal minimizing the mortality rate across the nation.


## Result:  Dramatically reduce the organ transplant waitlist mortality rate by moving people to where they have the greatest chance of receiving the donor they need.

The primary goal of the tool will be to determine the impact of optimizing where patients get placed on the liver transplant waitlist. Ideally, the tool will show a meaningful decrease in mortality rate if patients are afforded the opportunity to move to a different part of the country where there chances of success are significantly higher. If patients are to continue moving to different parts of the country, they should do so having confidence that their chances of success are significantly higher.
